This repository includes the data, code, and figures for our work on analysing the SHARC's Open Science Rewards and Incentives Survey. The survey addresses awareness of Open Science activities and existing & expected reward systems in research assessment, in particular for sharing activities, in different contexts.

This work is part of the Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The [RDA-SHARC IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sharing-rewards-and-credit-sharc-ig) is an interdisciplinary group set up to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the data/resource sharing process. The main goals are to foster the implementation of rewarding paths and encourage the adoption of data sharing activities-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the institutional, national and European/international levels.
