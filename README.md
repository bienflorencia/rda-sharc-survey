This repository includes the data, code, and figures for our work on analysing the SHARC's Open Science Rewards and Incentives Survey. The aim of this study was to identify perceptions and expectations of various research communities worldwide regarding how Open Science activities are (or should be) formally recognised and rewarded.

## Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) 

This work is part of the Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The [RDA-SHARC IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sharing-rewards-and-credit-sharc-ig) is an interdisciplinary group set up to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the data/resource sharing process. The main goals are to foster the implementation of rewarding paths and encourage the adoption of data sharing activities-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the institutional, national and European/international levels.
