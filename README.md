This work is part of the Sharing Rewards and Credit (SHARC) Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The [RDA-SHARC IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sharing-rewards-and-credit-sharc-ig) is an interdisciplinary group set up to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the data/resource sharing process. The main goals are to foster the implementation of rewarding paths and encourage the adoption of data sharing activities-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the institutional, national and European/international levels.
